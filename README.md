# Mapping_Earthquakes
Created a geographical visualization to map earthquake data by latitude and longitude from the USGS with Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface(API). 

## Software/Application
- `JavaScript`
- `Leaflet`
- `D3.js`
- `GeoJSON` files from:
  - Earthquakes 
  - Tectonic Plates
  - Major Earthquakes
- `HTML5`
- `CSS3`
- `Visual Studio Code`

## Project Overview 
The overview of this project incorporated and used the latest `GeoJSON` data on earthquakes worldwide using `JavaScript` and the open source `JavaScript` library `Leaflet`. One of the most crucial reasons that `Leaflet` was chosen for this project in particular is that  `Leaflet`is used to build web mapping applications and supports most mobile desktop platforms, supporting `HTML5` and `CSS3`. The purpose of this project was to convert the earthquake `GeoJSON` files using `JavaScript`, the Data Driven Documents `D3.js`, and `Leaflet` while also plotting the data on a mapbox map to an API request from the mapbox API key. 
From this, we were able to display and visualize the differences between magnitudes of earthquakes worldwide of the last seven days in correlation to the Earth's tectonic plate's location. 

## Results and Web Mapping Framework
To display the interactive web mapping website, the `static` folder and `html.index` file from the `Earthquake_Challenge` folder was duplicated outside of its directory and was then launched on [GitHub Pages](https://g626s.github.io/Mapping_Earthquakes/).
