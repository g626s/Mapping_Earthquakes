# Mapping_Earthquakes
Created a geographical visualization to map earthquake data by latitude and longitude from the USGS with Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface(API). 

## Project Overview 
The overview of this project incorporated and used the latest `GeoJSON` data on earthquakes worldwide using `JavaScript` and the open source `JavaScript` library `Leaflet`. One of the most crucial reasons that `Leaflet` was chosen for this project in particular is that  `Leaflet`is used to build web mapping applications and supports most mobile desktop platforms, supporting `HTML5` and `CSS3`. The purpose of this project was to convert the earthquake `GeoJSON` files using `JavaScript`, `D3.JS`, and `Leaflet` while also plotting the data on a mapbox map to an API request from the mapbox API key.
